        <h2>2018 Congress</h2>
        <p>The International Society for Universal Dialogue (ISUD) held its 12th World Congress in Lima, Peru from 10 July until 15 July, 2018. The hosting institution was the Pontifical Catholic University of Peru (Pontificia Universidad Católica del Perú, PUCP).</p>

        <p>The theme of the 2018 Congress was Philosophy in an Age of Crisis: Challenges and prospects.</p>
        <p>The goal of the Congress was to promote dialogue concerning various crucial philosophical issues in today’s world and to explore the role of philosophy in our complicated times. The world we live in today faces many urgent issues that require sustained and productive cross-cultural dialogue. The ideals of global peace and security remain elusive while a sense of uncertainty pervades the dominant institutions of contemporary life.</p>
        <p>Traditional human values underlying our social and political institutions are continually transformed by new developments in information technology, digitalization, artificial intelligence, and the drive for economic efficiency. Although the globalization of trade and technology has brought people together as never before, our differing outlooks, habits, and ideologies continue to separate us.</p>
